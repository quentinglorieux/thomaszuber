bio: >
  I am an economist at the Bank of France since September 2021 as well as a lecturer in PSE's PPD master program.
  I obtained my PhD from the Paris School of Economics.
  My main research interests are related to the different aspects of structural change: going from firm level responses
  to increased trade competition to occupational transitions in the labor market.
