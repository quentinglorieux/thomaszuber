  Analysis of job flows around firm financial distress using matched employer-employee, unemployment, and bankruptcy data.
abstract: >-
  Using linked employer-employee data matched to unemployment records as well as bankruptcy filings from France, this paper asks whether and how job flows react to the prospect of an upcoming financial turmoil. At the firm level we find that (i) distressed firms' layoffs start to increase two years prior to the actual bankruptcy filing and are followed one year later by a surge in job-to-job moves from departing employees. At the worker level we show that (ii) inherently productive individuals quit more frequently and sooner than less productive ones, that firm specific human capital decreases the probability of a layoff, and that firing costs play an important role in shaping bankrupt firms layoff policy. Finally, we find that (iii) workers in distressed firms are willing to accept significant earning cuts in order to escape the risk of a layoff, and that these earning cuts are driven by lower hours worked in the destination firm.
